For Implementing Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Problem:

1. Download the assignment folder with .py file and run the file with the appropriate IDE with numpy, csv, matplotlib and random libraries pre-installed.
2. Execute the code and the output will be printed as accuracies of Naive Bayes, mean and variance of the generated samples and accuracies of the logistic regression.
3. Sample output is inside the zip folder.
4. The Logistic Regression accuracy is observed to be higher in comparison to the Naive Bayes Classifier accuracy.
